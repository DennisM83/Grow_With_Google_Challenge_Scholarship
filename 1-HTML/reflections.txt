You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about
 web development here. Answer the following questions:


  * What new skills have you learned?

    I wouldn't say I learned any new skills, but it was the first time I got to use the strikethrough tag, the
    superscript tag and setup my semantics for an article.


  * What has been easy?

    Most of HTML markup is something I'm familiar with the Most


  * What has been difficult?

    I guess deciding if I mark it up from experience or by following the lessons and keeping it simple.


  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

    Just remembering to take everything in bite-sized chunks. I used this strategy to go line by line and 
    make sure to markup the mockup EXACTLY like I had saw it.
